# pocketwebradio

a mobile application which aggregates the webradios I bookmarked throughout the years.

- all radio stations are pulled by an online version of `stations.json`
- scrolling is bottom-up
- each time a station starts to play, it queues all other stations randomlyâ€”so that you can press the next button and not know what's coming next.

## install

the app is based on `react-native@0.69.5` and `react-native-track-player@^3.1.0`. it builds on android, but i haven't tried on ios.

you can also download it from the [play store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.pocketwebradio).
